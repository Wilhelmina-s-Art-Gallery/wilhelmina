In 2022 she led the coordination and installation of 23 monumental sculptures for the exhibition _Nothing is Permanent_ in the city of Esch-sur-Alzette, last year’s European Capital of Culture. Amongst them were works by Tony Cragg, Wim Delvoye, Katinka Bock, Tina Gillen, Hisae Ikenaga, Barthélémy Toguo, Bertrand, Ney, Wang Du, Guillaume Bijl, Bernard Venet and Erwin Wurm.

She was also the driving force behind Barthélémy Toguo’s retrospective exhibition _Faith Can Move Mountains_ at the Villa Merkel in Esslingen which brought together hundreds of watercolours, paintings, ceramics, installations and enamels from 1995 to the present day, including works that were created especially for the exhibition. For this she assisted Toguo in the production of three ceramic series in Malaga half of which were also exhibited at the Picasso Museum in Barcelona.

She has been on the panel for the first edition of the Andreas Neumann Prize in Saarbrucken and toured with Nosbaum Reding on the main European Art Fairs showing a range of emerging and established artists.
