description: "Xenia C.I. Vitos (b. London, 1977) is a British-Greek multidisciplinary artist currently living in Athens,Greece. She works with embroidery, beading, painting, photography amongst a wide range of other materials. Combining these mediums she constructs installations that narrate her personal reality morphing it into an altered playful/satirical version of itself. Through her artistic practice she mimics religious and folklore iconography in order to use it in her own twisted fairytale environments. Woven into the work is a commentary about Identity, familial ties, rhythms, femininity, biological surrender, the introspective space and Nostalgia. In addition to her artwork she designs ceramic jewelry and objects for her brand IZA,V.
