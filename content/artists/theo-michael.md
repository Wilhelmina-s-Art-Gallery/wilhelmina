description: "Theo Michael, a Greek artist based in Mexico and Athens, holds degrees in Fine Art from Aristotle University and Utrecht School Of Art, as well as a Masters from Wimbledon School Of Art. His diverse work has been exhibited globally, from Mexico City to Marseille, featured in various publications, and showcased in solo exhibitions. Michael's art spans graphite drawings of turbulent seas to speculative models of shelters, weathered digital collages, and sculptures. His approach challenges conventional thinking, incorporating self-vandalization as a method, and explores themes of ruination, evolution, and the blurring of cultural boundaries. Michael aims to create art that prompts curiosity, raising questions about alternative universes and histories."
