description: "Emma Ainala is known for her intricate, detailed works that explore mythologies and a variety of spaces, both physical and digital â€“ some even imagined. The human body, with its ambivalent gestures and expressions, is at the center of the works, being the object of the gaze and objectification are recurring themes. Her dreamlike paintings are at the same time very much in the present and contain references to art and cultural history. The thoughtful symbolism of the interiors of the works and the fragmented, dense surface enable several different interpretations and visits to parallel realities. Ainala's carefully stylized paintings are like performances of some unfinished and mysterious situation.."
