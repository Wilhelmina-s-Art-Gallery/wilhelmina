description: "The Callas, comprised of brothers Lakis and Aris Ionas, spearheads a Greek DIY movement, acting as a catalyst within a loose artistic collective engaged in the creation of artworks, films, and music. The duo, celebrating women, activism, and the spirit of experimentation, presents an array of original tapestries, playful installations, and mesmerizing spray paintings. Drawing inspiration from urban symbolism, collective archetypes, and diverse cultural references, The Callas' meta-punk distinctive style reflects a captivating fusion of Mediterranean psych-laden collective creativity. Their embroideries specifically weave together influences from sources such as the Memphis Group, Superstudio, Parthenis, Dorothy Iannone, and traditional flokati rugs, resulting in a compelling blend of contemporary and traditional elements. While the creative duo conceptualizes the designs, the tapestries come to life through the skilled craftsmanship of their mother, Ioanna, and aunt, Anastasia, at The Callas farm in Thermissia, Peloponnese. This unique DIY haven, situated amid olive and orange trees, serves as their laboratory, studio, festival space, and warehouse—a versatile hub for their artistic endeavors. The Callas has left an indelible mark on the global art scene through collaborations with iconic figures like Lee Ranaldo of Sonic Youth and Jim Sclavunos of Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds. Their impactful contributions are further evidenced by major museum shows, including a recent exhibition at Onassis Foundation – Stegi, and participation in renowned shows such as the New Museum in New York, DESTE Foundation in Athens, Documenta 14, Palais de Tokyo in Paris, and the Athens Biennial Kustera Projects in New York.
