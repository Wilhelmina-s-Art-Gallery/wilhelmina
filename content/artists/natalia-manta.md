description: "Manta, is an artist based in Athens, that holds a BFA and an MFA from the Athens School of Fine Arts. Central to her artistic quest is the exploration of the mythological element as a revelation of an inner memory that springs to life in the present, entwining with both local and global histories. While clay serves as her primary medium, she also adeptly navigates metal, wax, glass, and light-sensitive chemicals. Collaborating across various artistic disciplines, including visual, music, theatre, and performance arts, has been an integral part of her practice. Noteworthy collaborators include director Thodoris Ambazis, choreographer Androniki Marathaki, and musicians Jannis Anastasakis, Hayden Chisholm, SÃ©bastien Gramss, Savina Yannatou, and Evi Filippou. From 2017 to 2020, she taught as an assistant professor in the sculpture department at the Athens School of Fine Arts. Her work has been part of numerous solo and group exhibitions globally, making appearances at prestigious institutions such as the Korean International Ceramic Biennale, Eleusis European Capital of Culture, EMST, Onassis Culture, and Stavros Niarchos Foundation. She was honored with the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Artist Fellowship by ARTWORKS in 2022. Her creations find homes in private collections, embodying a fusion of material mastery and narrative resonance."
