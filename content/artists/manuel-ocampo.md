Manuel Ocampo was born in Quezon City (Philippines) in 1965. He currently lives and works in Manila (Philippines).

After graduating from the University of the Philippines, Manuel Ocampo moved to Los Angeles where he studied at the California State University of Bakersfield and graduated in 1985. He lived nearly ten years in California, where he had his first solo show in 1988, which paved the way to a successful international career. Two major events of the European contemporary art scene contributed to establish his notoriety: the Documenta IX of Cassel in 1992 (conceived by Jan Hoet) and the Venice Biennale in 1993.

Manuel Ocampo represented the Philippines at the 57th Venice Biennale (Italy) with _The Spectre of Comparison_, an exhibition curated by Joselina Cruz. His historic paintings from the 1990's entered in dialogue with more recent pieces. The artist represented the Philippines for the second time at the biennale.
