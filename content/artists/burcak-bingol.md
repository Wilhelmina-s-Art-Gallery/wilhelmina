description: "Burçak Bingöl’s works explore notions of belonging, cultural heritage, identity, decoration and failure by blurring the boundaries between these seemingly distinct notions. Through her labor- intensive process of tracing, copying and re-forming, she adopts an analytical approach to new configurations. The works are psychological landscapes that hover between abstraction and representation, rejection and preservation that both embrace and disregard Eastern and Western traditions. Working with various mediums such as ceramics, drawings, video, photography and installation, Bingöl’s works are constant re-working of materials and objects to converge to a repetitive act where fiction and failure merges."
