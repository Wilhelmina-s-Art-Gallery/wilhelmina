### An exhibition curated by Wilhelmina von Blumenthal &   Irini Karayannopoulou

**17th June - 21st July • Hydra Island, Greece**

Wilhelmina’s Art Gallery presents Magic Mirror, an exhibition curated by Wilhelmina von Blumenthal and artist Irini Karayannopoulou. It will take place in two historical
venues on Hydra Island, Greece, in the summer of 2024 and is devoted to the artist’s
power to reflect, transform and distort reality.

Thirty-three international artists (emerging and acclaimed) have been asked to present works where mirrors, their uses and their users play out in all their enchanting complexity through painting, collage, sculpture, film and photography.

This exhibition is a tapestry of illusions, a web of experiences that escape the
rational mind. Magic Mirror is a reflection on how we perceive the world; an invitation
to explore what lies beyond our immediate senses.
