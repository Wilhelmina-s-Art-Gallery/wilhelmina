title: "Wilhelmina's Art Gallery"
description: "Wilhelmina’s is excited to announce the gallery’s second show on Hydra in collaboration with the Nosbaum Reding gallery which will feature works by the world class international artists Barthélémy Toguo of Cameroon, Damien Deroubaix of France and Manuel Ocampo of the Philippines.
Inspired by Calderon de la Barca’s Golden Age play “Life is a Dream” these three artists highlight in new ways ideas and motifs particularly present in the Baroque period. They bring to life dreamlike and sometimes nightmarish visions of an invisible world which all have the same purpose : to remind us of what really matters in this fleeting world in which we are actors for a very short period of time.
