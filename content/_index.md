title: "Wilhelmina's Art Gallery"
description: "Wilhelmina’s Art Gallery is opening on Mandraki Bay with a solo exhibition by Bea Bonafini. (Under) Black Earth will immerse the viewer in a dreamlike dance between genres, histories and mythologies. Her works have been described as “swirling scenarios that are fragmented and multi-layered, optimistic and tender.” The title of this exhibition, borrowed from Sappho, alludes elegantly to these qualities and more.
