seoTitle: "Wilhelmina's Art Gallery: Portrait Artists"
description: "Wilhelmina’s Art Gallery exhibits contemporary works by International artists on Hydra between June and October. The exhibitions are displayed inside a historic building on Mandraki Beach that was once the Captain’s Mansion. This year the artists displayed are vastly different but share in common supreme technical skill and treat subjects rooted in universal themes, particularly nature, myth, philosophy and dreams."
summary: "Les expositions du peintre Silvère Jarrosson sont des jalons de son cheminement artistique, chacune abordant une thématique, un regard sur la peinture contemporaine et la façon de l'exposer. Solo ou collectives, en galerie ou dans des institutions culturelles, chacune traduit une certaine lecture de son œuvre."

## Poppy Field

(b. 1993; London, UK. Lives and works in London.)

Poppy graduated from the Courtauld in 2016 and trained in figurative sculpture at The Florence Academy of Art in Italy. During her time in Florence, Poppy gave lectures on the History of Art and was awarded a QEST Scholarship, a Leverhulme Trust Study Abroad Studentship and the Academy's Graduate in Residence Prize for sculpture. In 2019, Poppy's first life-size sculpture was commissioned in bronze, and she returned to the UK to set up her studio. In 2021, Poppy won her first public commission: two-metre bronze monuments of Her Majesty The Queen and Prince Philip, The Duke of Edinburgh. These will be installed in niches on The Royal Albert Hall's South Porch façade later this year.

Poppy combines traditional sculpting techniques with a painterly application of clay and bold, expressive gestures to bring her subjects to life. She layers clay and conversations to create vibrant surfaces, capturing the intangible essence of her subjects by building the sculptures from the inside out.

“Stories and bodies have always seemed intertwined to me, and I sculpt from life whenever possible. I have found that capturing that intangible thing, a kind of iconography of moments that someone else might call an essence, presence, or spirit, requires as much listening as modelling of form.”

### Portrait Commissions

Portrait commissions are fun and intimate experiences that one carries for life. It is rare to be able to deposit an experience in quite such a poetic manner. As a subject of the artist you develop a relationship with a person studying you intensely – trying to capture the essence of who you are forever. In the case of bronze one can add to that the weight of history behind this ancient material, its robustness and longevity.
